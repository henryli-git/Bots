# PDF Watermarker Bot

This bot adds watermark to your pdf files.

## Getting Started

I have included a sample watermark in this directory.  The watermark should be in pdf format and have a transparent background.
After running this script, the watermarked file will be in the same directory as your original pdf file.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or later is required.

Required python modules:

    *OS (included in standard library)
    *PyPDF2
