# Invoice Saver Renamer
I wrote this script to save invoices in my Outlook email based on invoice number. The script would save the pdf file, rename it, then move it to another folder. Modify the script to fit your needs. 
 
## Prerequisites
The Script is only compatible with Window OS and Outlook email.

Required python modules:

    *os
    *win32com.client
    *re
    *PyPDF2
